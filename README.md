# storeProvision
Simple store program.

The program recieves two string arrays as an input. The first array represents the current stock of the local store. The second array will contain products that the store has ordered for delivery.The following information applies to both arrays:
Every even index will hold the name of the product and every odd index will hold the quantity of that product. The second array could contain products that are already in the local store. If that happens the program increases the quantity for the given product. Products are stored into an object, and printed in the following format: (product -> quantity).
